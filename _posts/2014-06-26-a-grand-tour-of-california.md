At the start of June, Luke's parents came out to California for a visit. While this isn't our typical trip, we have some pictures we'd like to share, and maybe you can use our experiences as an action packed outline for your next visit to the Golden State.

<h2>San Francisco</h2>
We spent the first day in San Francisco riding the trolley, sampling chocolate at Ghirardelli, and freezing on the Golden Gate Bridge. The weather is San Francisco is ever changing so you really never know if you'll get a warm day with clear skies, or a chilly, foggy one like we did.

For other ideas on San Francisco, check out our previous blog: <a title="Coit Tower" href="http://destination-isolation.com/stairway-to-coit-tower/" target="_blank">Stairway to Coit Tower</a>

If you have more time in the city consider visiting Angel Island State Park: our review<a title="Angel Island State Park" href="http://destination-isolation.com/angel-island-hikenbike/" target="_blank"> here.</a>
<h2><!--more-->Mt. Diablo State Park and Napa Valley</h2>
We started the morning of the second day with a less frequented Bay Area sight. We drove to the summit of Mount Diablo which provides a nice panoramic of the area before whisking them to Napa Valley for some wine tasting.

<h2>Yosemite National Park</h2>
The real fun started on the third day, as we packed up and headed out for a 5-day tour of the Sierra Nevada.

Luke and I often feel cramped in our Jeep Wrangler. Luke built a box for the back that provides an added layer of storage as well as a sleeping platform. We also have a roof rack to store our goods but for some reason, we often lack room.

So when his parents decided to come for a visit, I was apprehensive about the truck's ability to hold 4 people and all their crap.

What does a Jeep owner do in this situation? Add another mod.

With new wood crossbars jerry-rigged to the roof, we could store 2 Rubbermaid boxes as well as the roof bag. Luke also added a couple more layers of storage on the inside such as netting above our heads. Man did that Jeep swallow a ton of gear! So off we went to see the Sierra Nevada!

This was a trip of highlights; we had seen most of the sights already but also threw in some new roads and a National Monument to keep us interested.

Our first stop was Yosemite National Park ($20/7 days or interagency pass) where we spent half a day touring the valley by shuttle bus. We camped in Tamarack Flat Campground ($10/night no water spigots). This campground is at the end of a dirt road and was fairly busy; we suspect it fills up quickly most weekends.

We drove out via Tioga Pass Road (CA 120). This route was new to us (at least in the daylight hours) and we were excited to see Half Dome from Olmsted Point. We also took note of the trailhead for potential backpacking and day hiking into the valley.

<h2>Mono Basin National Scenic Area.</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://photos.destination-isolation.com/A-Grand-Tour-of-California/i-z7mtB4V" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="DSC_0466.jpg" src="http://photos.destination-isolation.com/A-Grand-Tour-of-California/i-z7mtB4V/0/M/DSC_0466-M.jpg" alt="california; california state parks; inyo national forest; lake; mono basin national scenic area; mono lake; sierra nevada This view is right from the observation platform behind the Mono Basin Visitor Center in Lee Vining." width="600" /></a> This view is right from the observation platform behind the Mono Basin Visitor Center in Lee Vining.[/caption]

CA 120 leads in to the Mono Basin National Scenic Area in Inyo National Forest. Mono Lake is currently being revived after years of being cut off by dams. The inland sea was declared the first National Scenic Area by Congress in 1984. It has higher salinity than the oceans and incredibly high alkaline levels. Brine shrimp and Alkali Flies have adopted to the unique environment but are struggling to survive the damage inflicted by humans. The limestone tufas are a big attraction for the many visitors that walk the shore. There's an $5/person fee, but interagency passes are accepted. The basin is jointly managed by California State Parks and Forest Service.

<h2>Devils Postpile National Monument</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://photos.destination-isolation.com/A-Grand-Tour-of-California/i-4HXd7TM" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="DSC_0493.jpg" src="http://photos.destination-isolation.com/A-Grand-Tour-of-California/i-4HXd7TM/0/M/DSC_0493-M.jpg" alt="california; devils postpile national monument; geology; mammoth lakes; sierra nevada The formation (columnar basalt) came into being about 100,000 years ago by a lava flow." width="600" /></a> The formation (columnar basalt) came into being about 100,000 years ago by a lava flow.[/caption]

After exploring the tufa formations, we headed to the Twin Lakes Campground ($21/night), near Mammoth Lakes, to prepare for our visit to Devils Postpile National Monument ($10/day use or interagency pass). During the summer, a shuttle runs from Mammoth Lakes to the different sights but we were there the weekend before the shuttle started running (most years the park does not open until mid-June, when the snow clears). The area was originally part of Yosemite National Park but was removed under pressure from mining companies. Luckily, President Taft saw its value and protected it again with a presidential proclamation in 1911. The hike to the postpile is short and easy. If you have the time, you can hike to the top of the pile; we are told the climb is tough.
<h2>Manzanaar National Historic Site</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://photos.destination-isolation.com/A-Grand-Tour-of-California/i-5jWgnR4" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="DSC_0507.jpg" src="http://photos.destination-isolation.com/A-Grand-Tour-of-California/i-5jWgnR4/0/M/DSC_0507-M.jpg" alt="california; manzanar national historic site; sierra nevada Nearly 10,000 Japanese Americans spent the latter part of WWII in barracks like these at Manzanar. 120,000 were interned in concentration camps scattered around the country, typically in isolated, inhospitable places such as this." width="600" /></a> Nearly 10,000 Japanese Americans spent the latter part of WWII in barracks like these at Manzanar. 120,000 were interned in concentration camps scattered around the country, typically in isolated, inhospitable places such as this.[/caption]

Heading south along US 395 you will find the Manzanar National Historic Site, a little less than half way between Independence and Lone Pine. The monument sits atop the site of a WWII Japanese relocation/internment/concentration camp. At a point, nearly 10,000 individuals of Japanese ancestry were forcefully relocated to this barely-hospitable place. It is surely a dark part of American history worth exploring.
<h2>Mount Whitney</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://photos.destination-isolation.com/A-Grand-Tour-of-California/i-5CmXNj4" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="DSC_0527.jpg" src="http://photos.destination-isolation.com/A-Grand-Tour-of-California/i-5CmXNj4/0/M/DSC_0527-M.jpg" alt="california; mount whitney; river; sierra nevada; whitney portal; whitney portal falls Even if you" width="300" /></a> Even if you're not climbing the mountain, there's still plenty to see at Whitney Portal.[/caption]

From Lone Pine, heading West along the Whitney Portal Road will take you through the Alabama Hills, BLM land most famous as a backdrop for Hollywood films. You can also get the best views of Mount Whitney, at 14,505 feet, the tallest mountain in the Lower 48. We camped at the BLM operated Turtle Creek Campground ($5/night). Though we opted to do the drive to Whitney Portal, you don't get a view of the mountain from there.
<h2>Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://photos.destination-isolation.com/A-Grand-Tour-of-California/i-CWcBg8C" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="DSC_0566.jpg" src="http://photos.destination-isolation.com/A-Grand-Tour-of-California/i-CWcBg8C/0/M/DSC_0566-M.jpg" alt="california; kings river; river; sequoia  kings canyon national parks; sierra nevada Be careful playing around the river.

It is swift moving and the granite can be slick. All it takes is one slip to become a statistic.[/caption]

From here we headed to Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon National Parks ($20/7 day or interagency pass). We entered the park pretty late in the day as the drive from Whitney Portal through Kennedy Meadows is a REALLY long one. We camped at Stony Creek Campground ($24/night) in the National Forest lands that sit between the parks.

In the morning we took the park road to Kings Canyon to glimpse the immense river and canyon. We also made stops to admire the General Grant and Sherman Trees before the long drive back to Pittsburg. I am still amazed we all fit.

<h2>Big Basin Redwoods State Park and The Golden Gate Bridge</h2>
[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="http://photos.destination-isolation.com/A-Grand-Tour-of-California/i-9DxT943" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="DSC_0619.jpg" src="http://photos.destination-isolation.com/A-Grand-Tour-of-California/i-9DxT943/0/M/DSC_0619-M.jpg" alt="california; golden gate bridge; golden gate national recreation area; ocean; san francisco; san francisco bay area Because one can never take too many pictures of the GGB." width="300" /></a> Because one can never take too many pictures of the GGB.[/caption]

No visit to California is complete without dipping your toes in the Pacific Ocean. As a cool-down, we took the parental units on a drive down Skyline Boulevard, a scenic route through the Santa Cruz mountains to the West of San Francisco Bay. We drove through Big Basin Redwoods State Park, to see the the coastal redwoods (compare and contrast with the giant Sequoias of the Sierra Nevada). From there we headed towards CA 1 (stop in Santa Cruz if you have time) to visit Waddell Beach and take the scenic drive North along the coast.

It all ended where it started, with another visit to San Francisco to view the Golden Gate Bridge from its other end.
