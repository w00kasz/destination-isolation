A major blister stopped us from doing any serious hiking over President's Day weekend. Rather than lose the 3 day weekend to suburban boredom, we decided to head to Yosemite Valley. We camped at <strong>Camp 4 (first-come-first-served year round)</strong> and spent our time visiting museums, walking the valley floor, and photographing. Luke was able to get some great shots of the damage caused by the Rim Fire.

A note on Camp 4: This is a walk-in campground and multiple tents can be in one area. Each group should have access to a bear box. and everyone should pay the very small $5/night fee. However, this was not the case. Most people were disrespectful. Some people used multiple bear boxes, others did not pay. More than a few were loud all night (there are quiet hours). For some reason, a couple of campers thought it was okay to break branches off a living tree. Collecting fire wood is NOT allowed in Yosemite Valley. And even if it was, ripping branches from a living tree is inappropriate; the rule is dead and downed wood only, and it should be no longer than your forearm and no thicker than your wrist. Please abide by these simple rules.

If you are seeking a relaxing weekend, Camp 4 is not the place for you. Other campgrounds in the park are only slightly more expensive but are less abused.

The Hetch Hetchy Area of Yosemite National Park is very beautiful despite the dam. It is also underutilized. Trails lead deeper into the wilderness for those seeking backcountry adventure. A short walk across the dam is both lovely and informative for those that desire a short hike.

Hope you enjoy the rest of the shots!
