<p style="text-align: left;">Everyone we knew had been to New Orleans and they had all loved it. They shared lists of places to see, things to do, and drinks to consume. We were stoked! And then we got there.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We decided to do up Bourbon Street. You may enjoy the debauchery, but personally we found the party to be gaudy and overpriced. No one should ingest liquids that glow in the dark. Our lack of interest and low tolerance for the sugary battery acid did allow for an early bed time. Early to bed, early to rise.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">If you want to stay near the "action", the Provincial Hotel is nice, but pricey. We checked out in hopes of finding cheaper accommodations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But first laundry. If you ever need to use a laundromat (and even if you don't) in NOLA, head to <strong>Check Point Charlie</strong>. It's a bar so you can get a Bloody Mary while you wait. The bar hosts a gritty, knife yielding crowd but all in good fun.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Of course you need to be a tourist in the city so download one of the apps offered by the City Marketing Department. They provide walking tours and historical tidbits. We did a Riverwalk tour as well as a street car ride. If you get on the wrong street car and end up in City Park, fret not, this place offers walkways through pleasant scenery.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">After the insanity of Bourbon, a relaxing hostel in the Garden District is a welcome, and cheap, change. You can get a private room for $38. If you stay here, the Garden District Pub is nearby and has a few local beers on tap. This pub is not a tourist attraction but rather a legit local hangout. Mojo Coffeehouse is also nearby for some morning goodness. It is an artsy place with good grinds.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But once the glory of New Orleans begins to dim, jump in your car and head to <strong>Delta National Wildlife Area if you have a boat</strong> or are willing to charter one; otherwise the hour drive to get there is pointless as all you'll see is a chigger infested patch of grass and a wide water channel.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Enough with the city already! Off to Big Thicket National Preserve; "Deep in the heart of Texas".</p>
