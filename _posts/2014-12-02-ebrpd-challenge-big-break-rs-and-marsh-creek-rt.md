<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Big Break Regional Shoreline</span> - paved trails, exhibits, kayaking</h3>
For those of us that live in the Pittsburg/Antioch/Oakley area, Big Break Regional Shoreline is great day trip.

The area, used by farmers for many years, was so named after a 1928 break in one of the levees which separated an asparagus farm from the San Joaquin River. More information can be found at the <a title="EBRPD - Big Break RP" href="http://www.ebparks.org/parks/big_break" target="_blank">East Bay Regional Park District</a> website.

The park offers kayak rentals (or bring your own) and tours, interactive exhibits that teach us about the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and its importance as a water source, and a Visitor's Center featuring the wildlife and plant life of the Delta and surrounding area.

<em>Note: If you bring your own kayak, you can borrow a cart to help you get it from the car to the shore.</em>

Bird watching from your kayak is great here. Many ducks, herons, and pelicans find sanctuary in the area.

The Delta Discovery Experience is a must, especially if you have children. It includes a large, 3-D map of the watershed you can walk on and explore. Picnic tables are located nearby to enjoy the Delta views.

As California's drought intensifies, education will be crucial as we strive to be more water efficient. This park does a great job of explaining where out water comes from and how we can protect it.

The park also houses the paved Big Break Regional Trail which weaves in and around the marsh. The marsh to the North of the trail is protected, but directly to the South lieÂ industrialized lands backed by Mount Diablo. The contrast is quite startling.

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marsh Creek Regional Trail</span> - paved, 8.5 miles (plus mileage on Big Break RT)</h3>
After about 2.5 miles on the Big Break Regional Trail, you will turn South to connect with the Marsh Creek Regional Trail. At first, the trail weaves between housing complexes until finally running along orchards. The segment South of Delta Road is my person favorite, there are a few parking spots along this road.

The entire length of the trail has a surprising amount of wildlife including Great Blue Herons, ducks, turtles, Snowy Egrets, Great Egrets, and cats.

Marsh Creek is an incredibly rich ecosystem that is, unfortunately, degraded by waste. Hundreds of plastic water bottles littered the water and shoreline. It is important for all us us to be better stewards of our lands and waters. Remember, what you throw on the street might end up in our waterways!

There are a few city parks along the trail that offer restrooms and water.

For a longer biking trip, use West Cypress Road, near the North end of the trail, to connect to the Delta De Anza Trail.
