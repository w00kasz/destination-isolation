<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Core Mission</span></h3>
We will acquire, develop, manage, and maintain a high quality, diverse system of interconnected parklands which balances public usage and education programs with protection and preservation of our natural and cultural resources.
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">History</span></h3>
The East Bay Regional Park District was created in 1934 by a decisive public vote. Early advocates for the park district sought to protect open spaces for their benefit and enjoyment. Many of the lands were originally in the hands of the East Bay Municipal Utility District; EBMUD had excess lands that it wished to sell. Rather than let the lands fall to the hands of developers, citizens rose up to protect them as parklands.

Tilden (originally Wildcat Canyon), Sibley Volcanic (originally Roundtop), and Lake Temescal became the first parks to open on October 18, 1936. Currently, according to the <a title="East Bay Regional Park District" href="http://www.ebparks.org/about" target="_blank">EBRPD website</a>, they operate 65 areas and 29 regional trails. There is something for everyone in these parks; swimming, picnic areas, interpretive hikes, kayaking, fishing, backpacking, and even golf.

The park district is headquartered in Oakland and operates in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties as a Special District. A Special District can best be explained as a independent government agency that provides a specialized service (or services) within a defined boundary. Special Districts are formed at the behest of local residents that seek a service that the county, city, or state they live in is not able to provide.

The East Bay Regional Park District Mission: "We will acquire, develop, manage, and maintain a high quality, diverse system of interconnected parklands which balances public usage and education programs with protection and preservation of our natural and cultural resources."

The park district is taxpayer funded and the Board of Directors are publicly elected officials. The Regional Parks Foundations is a non-profit which provides further support to the East Bay Regional Parks.
