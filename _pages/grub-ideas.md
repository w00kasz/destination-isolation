Back in the early days, we ate a lot of Mountain House and dealt with the bloat caused by excessive sodium. Many things have changed since then. For one, we are now vegan. For two, we own a dehydrator.

Dehydrating your own food can open up a whole new window to trail-side deliciousness. We wish we had the Excalibur Dehydrator which gets the best reviews (especially by raw foodists who are champion dehydrators). It might be more costly than other options but even airflow is so crucial to success.

Most recipes can be dried so next time you make a sauce, double the batch and throw half in the dehydrator (lower-fat foods dehydrate the best). Once it's done you can throw it in a grinder to pulverize the sauce and store it in a Ziploc in the freezer until your trip. Lighter than light.

Vegetables can be lightly steamed and then dehydrated for pasta or burrito add-ins.

Dehydrated fruits make great snacks or cereal toppers, just slice them thin to limit drying time.

For pasta we use kid style ABCs or angel hair pasta. Both cook crazy fast, limiting fuel needed.

And don't forget the beer, ever!
